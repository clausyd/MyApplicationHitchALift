Once the user registers an accout the can then create journeys and share them via the app. The person that is looking for a lift can then view the journey that match the criteria get the persons email and email them to accept the lift.

In my user screen there is an option to view the users journeys. For this i user a swipe listveiew that i found on github. In the swipe listview there is an option to delete the journey and update the journey. The delete works but it doesn't update until the user log's out and logs back in again.
